# Databricks Driver {{ version }}

{{ heading|safe }}

This driver provides access to [Databricks][databricks], a
cloud-based platform for data analytics.

## Installation

The Databricks driver can be installed with [dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc):

```bash
dbc install databricks
```

## Connecting

TODO: This section once https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/pull/3771 is merged here.

To connect, edit the `uri` option below to match your environment and run the following:

```python
from adbc_driver_manager import dbapi

conn = dbapi.connect(
  driver="databricks",
  db_kwargs = {
    "uri": "TODO"
  }
)
```

Note: The example above is for Python using the [adbc-driver-manager](https://pypi.org/project/adbc-driver-manager) package but the process will be similar for other driver managers.
