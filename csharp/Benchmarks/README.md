# Databricks CloudFetch E2E Benchmark

Real end-to-end benchmark for measuring memory usage and performance of the Databricks CloudFetch implementation against an actual Databricks cluster.

## Overview

This benchmark tests the complete CloudFetch flow with real queries against a Databricks warehouse:
- Full end-to-end CloudFetch flow (query execution, downloads, LZ4 decompression, batch consumption)
- Real data from Databricks tables
- Memory usage tracking with actual network I/O
- Power BI consumption simulation with batch-proportional delays (5ms per 10K rows)

## Quick Start - Running Locally

### Prerequisites

Create a JSON config file with your Databricks cluster details:

```json
{
  "uri": "https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com/sql/1.0/warehouses/xxx",
  "token": "dapi...",
  "query": "select * from main.tpcds_sf1_delta.catalog_sales",
  "type": "databricks"
}
```

Or use OAuth client credentials:

```json
{
  "uri": "https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com/sql/1.0/warehouses/xxx",
  "auth_type": "oauth",
  "grant_type": "client_credentials",
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
  "query": "select * from main.tpcds_sf1_delta.catalog_sales",
  "type": "databricks"
}
```

### Run the Benchmark

```bash
# Set configuration
export DATABRICKS_TEST_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/databricks-config.json

# Run via CI script
./ci/scripts/csharp_benchmark.sh $(pwd) net8.0

# Or run directly
cd csharp/Benchmarks
dotnet run -c Release --project DatabricksBenchmarks.csproj --framework net8.0 -- --filter "*CloudFetchRealE2E*"
```

### Understanding Local Results

**Console output during execution:**
```
Loaded config from: /path/to/databricks-config.json
Hostname: adb-xxx.azuredatabricks.net
HTTP Path: /sql/1.0/warehouses/xxx
Query: select * from main.tpcds_sf1_delta.catalog_sales
Benchmark will test CloudFetch with 5ms per 10K rows read delay

// Warmup
CloudFetch E2E [Delay=5ms/10K rows] - Peak memory: 272.97 MB
WorkloadWarmup   1: 1 op, 11566591709.00 ns, 11.5666 s/op

// Actual iterations (3 runs)

## CI/CD Automation

### Overview

Benchmarks run automatically via GitHub Actions on every commit to the `main` branch:

- **Multi-platform**: .NET 8.0 (Ubuntu) and .NET Framework 4.7.2 (Windows)
- **Performance tracking**: Min Execution Time, Peak Memory, Allocated Memory, and Gen2 Collections
- **Artifact storage**: Detailed results retained for 90 days
- **Trend tracking**: GitHub Pages with interactive performance charts
- **Regression alerts**: Triggers if metrics regress significantly
- **PR benchmarking**: Label-based performance testing with automatic comparison comments

### Viewing CI Results

1. **GitHub Actions**: Go to **Actions → Performance Benchmarks** to see run history
2. **Artifacts**: Download detailed HTML/JSON/CSV reports from each run (90-day retention)
3. **Trend Charts**: View performance trends at https://adbc-drivers.github.io/databricks/bench/

### Manual Trigger

You can manually trigger a benchmark run:

1. Go to **Actions → Performance Benchmarks → Run workflow**
2. Select the `main` branch
3. Optionally specify a custom SQL query
4. Click **Run workflow**

**Note**: Manual triggers require write access to the repository.

### Pull Request Benchmarking (Label-Based)

Test performance impact of your changes **before merging** using label-based PR benchmarks:

#### How to Run Benchmarks on a PR:

1. **Open your PR** (or navigate to an existing PR)
2. **Add the `benchmark` label**:
   - Click "Labels" in the right sidebar
   - Select `benchmark` from the dropdown
   - Save
3. **Wait ~30 minutes** for the workflow to complete
4. **Review the comparison comment** automatically posted on your PR

#### What You Get:

The workflow will automatically post **two separate comments** comparing your PR against the main branch baseline:

**Comment 1: .NET 8.0 Results**
```markdown
## 🎯 Benchmark Results (.NET 8.0)

| Metric | Baseline (main) | This PR | Change | Status |
|--------|----------------|---------|--------|--------|
| Min Execution Time (s) | 3.794 | 3.821 | +0.7% | ✅ |
| Peak Memory (MB) | 420.98 | 398.12 | -5.4% | 🟢 |
| Allocated Memory (MB) | 286.19 | 275.43 | -3.8% | 🟢 |
| Gen2 Collections | 61 | 58 | -4.9% | 🟢 |
```

**Comment 2: .NET Framework 4.7.2 Results**
```markdown
## 🎯 Benchmark Results (.NET Framework 4.7.2)

| Metric | Baseline (main) | This PR | Change | Status |
|--------|----------------|---------|--------|--------|
| Min Execution Time (s) | 4.123 | 4.201 | +1.9% | ✅ |
| Peak Memory (MB) | 346.19 | 331.03 | -4.4% | 🟢 |
| Allocated Memory (MB) | 539.65 | 530.39 | -1.7% | ✅ |
| Gen2 Collections | 7 | 7 | 0.0% | ✅ |
```

**Indicators:**
- 🟢 **Improvement** - Metric improved by >30%
- ✅ **No significant change** - Within ±30%
- ⚠️ **Regression** - Metric degraded by >30%
- ➖ **New metric** - No baseline data available (first run)

#### Key Features:

- ✅ **Opt-in**: Only runs when you add the label (cost-effective)
- ✅ **Automatic comparison**: Shows exact performance impact vs baseline
- ✅ **Non-blocking**: Alerts don't fail the workflow
- ✅ **Accessible**: Any contributor with write access can add labels
- ✅ **No gh-pages pollution**: PR results aren't added to historical tracking

#### Alert Threshold:

The workflow alerts if any metric regresses by **>30%** compared to baseline. This helps identify:
- Performance regressions before merging
- Memory leaks or increased allocations
- Changes that trigger excessive garbage collections

**Note**: Alerts are informational only and won't block your PR. Use them to make informed decisions about performance trade-offs.

## CI/CD Setup Guide

### Required GitHub Secrets

Configure these secrets under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Environment secrets** for the `azure-prod` environment:

- `DATABRICKS_HOST`: Databricks workspace hostname (e.g., `adb-xxx.azuredatabricks.net`)
- `TEST_PECO_WAREHOUSE_HTTP_PATH`: SQL warehouse HTTP path (e.g., `/sql/1.0/warehouses/xxx`)
- `DATABRICKS_TEST_CLIENT_ID`: OAuth client ID for M2M authentication
- `DATABRICKS_TEST_CLIENT_SECRET`: OAuth client secret for M2M authentication

### Enabling Trend Tracking (GitHub Pages)

The workflow uses [`benchmark-action/github-action-benchmark`](https://github.com/benchmark-action/github-action-benchmark) to track performance trends over time.

**Enable GitHub Pages:**

1. Go to **Settings → Pages**
2. Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**
3. Select branch: **gh-pages** and folder: **/ (root)**
4. Click **Save**

**Configure GitHub Actions permissions:**

1. Go to **Settings → Actions → General**
2. Under "Workflow permissions", select **Read and write permissions**
3. Check **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**
4. Click **Save**

**First run:**
- The first benchmark run will automatically create the `gh-pages` branch
- Subsequent runs will push benchmark data to this branch
- GitHub Pages will be available at: https://adbc-drivers.github.io/databricks/bench/

---

## Configuration

### Default Benchmark Query

```sql
select * from main.tpcds_sf1_delta.catalog_sales
```

This query processes approximately 1.4M rows and tests CloudFetch with realistic data volumes.

**Using a custom query:**
1. Trigger the workflow manually (Actions → Performance Benchmarks → Run workflow)
2. Enter your custom query in the "Custom SQL query" field
3. The query will be added to the config file automatically

### Alert Thresholds

- **PR benchmarks**: Alert if any metric regresses by >30%
- **Main branch**: Alert if metrics increase by >150% (2.5x baseline)

Alerts are informational only and don't fail the workflow.

### Timeout

Each benchmark job has a 30-minute timeout. Adjust if needed:

```yaml
jobs:
  benchmark-net8:
    timeout-minutes: 30  # Adjust this value
```

---

## Interpreting Results

### Artifacts

After each CI run, detailed results are uploaded as artifacts (90-day retention):

- `benchmark-results-net8`: Results from .NET 8.0 benchmark
- `benchmark-results-net472`: Results from .NET Framework 4.7.2 benchmark

Each artifact contains:
- **JSON report** (`*-report-full-compressed.json`): Complete benchmark results with detailed metrics used for trend tracking

### Key Metrics

**Tracked in GitHub Pages (trend analysis):**

1. **Min Execution Time (seconds)**: Best (fastest) execution time across benchmark iterations
   - Primary performance metric tracked on GitHub Pages
   - End-to-end time including query execution, CloudFetch downloads, LZ4 decompression, and batch consumption
   - Lower is better (tracks performance improvements)
   - Alert threshold: 130% on PRs (30% regression warning)
   - Source: BenchmarkDotNet's `Statistics.Min`

2. **Peak Memory (MB)**: Maximum working set memory (private bytes) during execution
   - Lower is better
   - Alert threshold: 150% on main, 130% on PRs
   - Source: Custom metrics from `Process.PrivateMemorySize64`

3. **Allocated Memory (MB)**: Total managed memory allocated during execution
   - Lower is better
   - Alert threshold: 150% on main, 130% on PRs
   - Source: BenchmarkDotNet's `MemoryDiagnoser`

4. **Gen2 Collections**: Number of full garbage collections
   - Lower is better (indicates less memory pressure)
   - Alert threshold: 150%
   - Source: BenchmarkDotNet's `MemoryDiagnoser`

**Additional metrics in BenchmarkDotNet reports:**

5. **Total Rows/Batches**: Data volume processed

6. **GC Time %**: Percentage of time spent in garbage collection

7. **Gen0/Gen1 Collections**: Minor and partial garbage collections

### Trend Analysis

The GitHub Pages dashboard shows:
- **Execution time trends**: Line chart of Mean/Min/Max execution time across commits
- **Memory usage trends**: Line chart of Peak Memory, Allocated Memory, and Gen2 Collections across commits
- **Regression detection**: Automatic alerts when performance degrades (memory increases by 150%+)
- **Comparison view**: Compare performance between different commits

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Issues

**Issue**: Workflow fails with "Config file not found"
- **Solution**: Verify GitHub secrets are properly configured in the `azure-prod` environment

**Issue**: Benchmark times out (>30 minutes)
- **Solution**: Increase `timeout-minutes` value in the workflow or use a smaller test query

**Issue**: Trend tracking not working
- **Solution**: Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled and workflow has write permissions

**Issue**: Results not showing in GitHub Pages
- **Solution**: Wait a few minutes after the first run for Pages to deploy, then check the `gh-pages` branch

### Local Execution Issues

**Issue**: "DATABRICKS_TEST_CONFIG_FILE environment variable must be set"
- **Solution**: Set the environment variable: `export DATABRICKS_TEST_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/config.json`

**Issue**: Authentication fails
- **Solution**: Verify your token or OAuth credentials are correct in the config file

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does the benchmark run on every commit to main?

**No** - Benchmarks only run when relevant files change:

```yaml
paths:
  - '.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml'  # Workflow changes
  - 'csharp/src/**'                     # Driver source code
  - 'csharp/Benchmarks/**'              # Benchmark code
```

**Runs when:**
- ✅ You change driver source code
- ✅ You change benchmark code
- ✅ You modify the workflow itself

**Doesn't run when:**
- ❌ Documentation-only changes
- ❌ Test-only changes (unless they affect src/)
- ❌ Changes to unrelated parts of the repository

This selective triggering saves CI resources and provides faster feedback for non-performance changes.

### Do performance alerts block check-ins?

**No** - Alerts are informational only and do **not** block merges or fail the workflow.

**For PRs:** If metrics regress by >30%, a warning (⚠️) appears in the comparison comment but doesn't fail the workflow.

**For main branch:** If metrics regress by >150%, an alert appears in GitHub Pages dashboard but the workflow still passes.

**Why non-blocking?**
- Critical bug fixes shouldn't be blocked by performance alerts
- Performance trade-offs are sometimes intentional
- Alerts provide visibility while allowing informed decisions

### How do I investigate a performance regression?

When an alert triggers:

1. **Check GitHub Pages dashboard** - View the trend chart to see the increase
2. **Download artifacts** - Get the detailed benchmark reports from the workflow run
3. **Compare commits** - Use the comparison view to see what changed
4. **Review the code** - Look at the changes that caused the regression
5. **Assess trade-off** - Determine if the regression is acceptable
6. **Create follow-up** - If needed, create a PR to optimize performance

---

## Best Practices

1. **Run benchmarks on stable infrastructure**: CI uses GitHub-hosted runners which may have variable performance
2. **Use consistent test data**: The default TPC-DS query provides consistent results across runs
3. **Monitor trends, not absolute values**: Focus on relative changes over time
4. **Review alerts promptly**: Performance regressions should be investigated quickly
5. **Keep benchmarks fast**: Long-running benchmarks slow down the CI pipeline
